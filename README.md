# FYS SDK for FYS API

The FYS SDK is a .NET library that provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the FYS API. It simplifies the process of integrating your applications with the FYS platform and accessing its features.

## Features

- **Simplified API Calls**: The SDK encapsulates the complexity of API requests and responses, allowing you to make API calls using simple methods.
- **Authentication Handling**: The SDK provides built-in authentication mechanisms and helps you manage authentication tokens or credentials required for accessing the FYS API securely.
- **Error Handling**: Easily handle and manage errors returned by the API, including custom exception types specific to the SDK.
- **High-Level Abstractions**: The SDK provides high-level abstractions and data models that align with the concepts and entities of the FYS API, making it easier to work with the API data.

## Installation

You can install the FYS SDK via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FYS.SDK). Simply run the following command in the Package Manager Console:


## Usage

To get started with the FYS SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the SDK**: Create an instance of the `SdkClient` class by passing the appropriate configuration options.

   ```csharp
   var configuration = new SdkConfiguration(apiKey, baseUrl);
   var client = new SdkClient(configuration);

2. **Make API Requests:** Use the methods provided by the SdkClient class to interact with the FYS API.
   ```csharp
   var endpoint = "/api/resource";
   var response = await client.GetApiResponseAsync(endpoint);

3. **Handle Responses:** Process the API responses according to your application's requirements.
   ```csharp
	if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(response))
    {
        // Handle the successful API response
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle the empty or error response
    }
